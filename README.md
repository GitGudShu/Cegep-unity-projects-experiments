# Introduction:

This repository contains a collection of test projects made in Unity to showcase various features and techniques, including a shader experiment. These projects are not intended for commercial use but rather for educational purposes. Feel free to use, modify, or distribute them as per the MIT license.

# Experiments:

- Camera Follow: This project demonstrates how to make a camera follow a player object in a 2D game.
- Jumping Character: This project shows how to make a character jump in a 3D game using Unity's physics engine.
- Tower Defense: This project demonstrates how to create a basic tower defense game using Unity's built-in components.
- Procedural Generation: This project shows how to use Unity's procedural generation tools to create a random terrain for a 2D game.
- AI Enemy: This project demonstrates how to create an enemy with basic AI that follows and attacks the player in a 3D game.
- Inventory System: This project shows how to create a basic inventory system for a 2D game.
- Shader Experiment: This project showcases a shader experiment that creates a wavy, ripple effect on a plane using a custom shader.

# Installation:

To install and run any of the projects, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Open Unity and select "Open Project."
- Navigate to the cloned repository and select the desired project folder.
- Once the project is open, navigate to the "Scenes" folder and open the main scene.
- Press the play button to start the game.

### Shader Experiment:

The shader experiment project showcases a custom shader that creates a wavy, ripple effect on a plane. The shader uses a sine wave function to create the waves and offsets the UV coordinates of the mesh based on the current time to create a rippling effect. The project also includes a script that controls the speed and magnitude of the waves, allowing you to experiment with different wave patterns.

# Conclusion:

These test projects are designed to showcase various features and techniques in Unity, including a custom shader experiment. Feel free to use them as a starting point for your own projects or modify them to suit your needs. We hope you find them helpful in your game development journey. If you have any questions or feedback, please feel free to create an issue or contact us.
